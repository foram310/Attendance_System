👥 Smart Attendance System (Face Recognition)

A simple Python project that marks student attendance automatically using face recognition and stores the details in an Excel sheet.

This project uses Tkinter/GUI + face recognition + ML models for spoof detection and age/gender estimation (models kept locally).

📌 Features

📸 Detects a student’s face

🎭 Recognizes identity using saved images

🔒 Anti-spoofing check (model used locally)

🧠 Age & gender model (local)

📝 Automatically records attendance into Excel

🖥️ Simple Tkinter-based GUI


🧠 How It Works

The webcam captures the face

Face recognition matches it with images inside faces/

Anti-spoofing model checks if the face is real

If match is found → attendance recorded

Details are stored as:

Student ID

Name

Date

Time
